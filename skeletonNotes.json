Death. Despair. Oppression. Environmental ruin. Reading dystopian novels allows us to experience these things without actually living through them. It feels honest to read about a future that is negative because we know that awful things are capable of being done by politicians, military people, and corporate moguls. "},{"name":"part2","script":" \n\nPart 2: The Hunger Games trilogy, for example, feels honest because it portrays the severe physical and psychological damage caused by dictatorship, revolution, and counterrevolution. Other notable dystopian novels, such as Brave New World, 1984, The Handmaid's Tale, and The Road, also explore themes of carnage, inhumanity, and hopelessness.
