Death. Despair. Oppression. Environmental ruin. Dystopian novels have it all! Yet many of us love this genre. For one thing, we're reading about rather than actually living through the bad stuff happening in the near or far future. And, while dystopian novels are depressing, there's a certain \"rightness\" in reading about a negative future. \n\nWe know that politicians, military people, and corporate moguls are capable of doing awful things. Dictatorship, revolution, and counterrevolution usually cause severe physical and psychological damage to the victims and other participants. Dystopian novels depict people we can relate to, and we're fascinated by the terrible things these characters face. We admire the best dystopian novels because they're written well and show how people react to adversity. \n\nWe're enraged by what despots and other vicious officials are doing to citizens, and we wonder if rebels and other members of the populace can somehow remake a wretched society. By giving us worst-case scenarios of the future, maybe our current society can be jolted enough to avoid those scenarios eventually happening in real life."},"1":{"script":""}}
